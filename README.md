The "coregistration final" jupiter notebook finds contours of cells extracted from microscopy images and overlays them on mass spectrometry images
of the same colony and extracts cell by cell metabolite abundance data. It can also convert your MALDI mass spectrometry images .imzML file to an Excel file with
pixelwise intensities. Files "coregistration metrics.py" and "imzmlparser.py" contain the necessary functions for the pipeline.
